# Workflow Architecture Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Complete Workflow Engine Built
- **Schema Definition** (`src/workflows/schemas/workflow-schema.json`) - Validates all workflow definitions
- **Workflow Loader** - Loads and validates YAML/JSON workflows from disk
- **Workflow Parser** - Resolves expressions like `${inputs.FEATURE_ID}` and evaluates conditions
- **Workflow Context** - Manages execution state, variables, and history
- **Workflow Registry** - Discovers, indexes, and searches available workflows
- **Workflow Executor** - Executes workflow steps (basic implementation ready for enhancement)

### 2. All 14 Workflows Converted
Successfully migrated all workflows from hardcoded HTML to structured YAML format:

#### Master Workflows (Orchestration)
- `wf0-feature-development.yaml` - End-to-end feature development
- `wf1-bug-fix.yaml` - Bug fixing process
- `wf2-hotfix.yaml` - Emergency production fixes

#### Core Workflows (Development)
- `wf3-branch-creation.yaml` - Standardized branch creation
- `wf4-code-commit.yaml` - Commit with conventional format
- `wf5-pull-request-creation.yaml` - Create and configure PRs
- `wf6-pull-request-review.yaml` - Review PRs (as reviewer)
- `wf7-pull-request-response.yaml` - Respond to PR feedback (as author)
- `wf8-merge.yaml` - Merge PRs with various strategies

#### Support Workflows (Utilities)
- `wf9-post-merge-monitoring.yaml` - Monitor after deployment
- `wf10-conflict-resolution.yaml` - Handle merge conflicts
- `wf11-rollback.yaml` - Emergency rollback procedures
- `wf12-work-item-update.yaml` - Update Azure DevOps items
- `wf13-pr-readiness-check.yaml` - Validate PR readiness

### 3. Persona Integration Ready
- **WorkflowEnabledProcessor** - Base class for workflow-capable personas
- **SteveWorkflowProcessor** - Example security persona using workflows
- Personas can now:
  - Discover available workflows
  - Execute workflows with inputs
  - Get recommendations based on work items
  - Track workflow execution history

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns** ✓
   - Workflows no longer embedded in 3000+ lines of HTML
   - Clean YAML definitions in organized directories

2. **Programmatic Access** ✓
   - Personas can discover and execute any workflow
   - No more copy-paste from UI code

3. **Maintainability** ✓
   - Version-controlled workflow definitions
   - Schema validation ensures consistency
   - Easy to update without touching UI

4. **Extensibility** ✓
   - Simple to add new workflows
   - New action types can be added to executor
   - Workflows can call other workflows

5. **Reusability** ✓
   - Any persona can use any workflow
   - Workflows can be composed into larger processes

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Workflow System
```bash
cd /opt/ai-personas
python3 test_workflow_system.py
```

### 2. List All Workflows
```python
from src.workflow_engine import WorkflowRegistry

registry = WorkflowRegistry()
registry.scan_workflows()

# List all workflows
workflows = registry.list_workflows()
for wf in workflows:
    print(f"{wf['id']}: {wf['name']} ({wf['type']})")
```

### 3. Execute a Workflow
```python
from src.workflow_engine import WorkflowExecutor, WorkflowRegistry
import asyncio

async def test_branch_creation():
    registry = WorkflowRegistry()
    executor = WorkflowExecutor(registry)
    
    # Execute branch creation workflow
    context = await executor.execute_workflow('wf3-branch-creation', {
        'WORK_TYPE': 'feature',
        'WORK_ITEM_ID': 'TEST-123',
        'DESCRIPTION': 'test-feature'
    })
    
    print(f"Status: {context.status}")
    print(f"Branch created: {context.variables['outputs'].get('BRANCH_NAME')}")

asyncio.run(test_branch_creation())
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. **Update workflow references** - Change from old IDs to wf0-wf13 format
2. **Implement missing actions** in executor:
   - `azure-devops` operations
   - `git-operation` commands
   - `for-loop` and `parallel` execution

### Short Term
1. **Update UI** to load workflows dynamically from YAML files
2. **Add workflow execution UI** for manual triggering
3. **Create workflow editor** interface
4. **Add execution monitoring** dashboard

### Long Term
1. **Workflow versioning** - Support multiple versions
2. **Workflow marketplace** - Share workflows between teams
3. **Visual workflow designer** - Drag-and-drop interface
4. **Advanced features**:
   - Conditional branching UI
   - Workflow templates
   - Custom action plugins
