# Decision: Agent Provider UI Redesign

**Date**: 2025-01-09
**Status**: Implemented
**Author**: Claude

## Context
The AI Agent providers interface needed to be consistent with the tool categories design for better user experience.

## Decision
Transform the provider sections to use the same expand/collapse pattern as tool categories.

## Implementation Details
1. Used `workflow-section` classes for consistent styling
2. Added expand/collapse arrows using HTML entities (&#9650;/&#9660;)
3. Moved provider descriptions inside expanded sections
4. Added model counts in badges
5. Implemented full CRUD operations for custom providers

## Consequences
- ✅ Consistent UI across all settings tabs
- ✅ Better organization with collapsible sections
- ✅ Support for unlimited custom AI providers
- ✅ Secure API key storage pattern maintained
