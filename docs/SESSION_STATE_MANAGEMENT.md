# Session State Management

## Overview

The AI Personas project now includes a robust session state management system that properly saves and restores complete todo items with their full descriptions, status, and priority information.

## Problem Solved

Previously, the session state only saved todo IDs (e.g., [18, 20, 21, 24, 25]) without their descriptions, making it impossible to resume work after a session ended. This has been fixed with the new SessionStateManager.

## Components

### 1. SessionStateManager (`src/commands/session_state_manager.py`)

The core component that handles:
- Saving complete todo items with all metadata
- Loading session state from file or Memory MCP
- Formatting todos for display
- Statistics tracking (completed, pending, in-progress)

### 2. Todo Hook (`src/commands/todo_hook.py`)

Automatic integration with TodoWrite tool:
- Saves state whenever todos are updated
- Prepares Memory MCP entities
- Maintains session continuity

### 3. Updated Commands

- **PrepareCommand**: Now uses SessionStateManager to save complete todos
- **RememberCommand**: Properly restores full todo items with descriptions

## Session State Format v2.0

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-05T14:30:00",
  "version": "2.0",
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "content": "Full description of the task",
      "status": "pending|in_progress|completed",
      "priority": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ],
  "current_task": "Description of current work",
  "context": {
    "project": "AI Personas",
    "working_dir": "/opt/ai-personas",
    "api_port": 8080,
    "dashboard_port": 3000
  },
  "discoveries": ["List of discoveries"],
  "next_steps": ["List of next steps"],
  "statistics": {
    "total_todos": 17,
    "completed": 1,
    "pending": 16,
    "in_progress": 0
  }
}
```

## Memory MCP Integration

The session state is saved to Memory MCP as a `CurrentSessionState` entity with:
- Summary observations about the session
- Complete JSON state as the final observation
- Automatic cleanup of old session states

## Usage

### Saving State
```python
from commands.session_state_manager import get_session_manager

manager = get_session_manager()
saved_state = manager.save_session_state(
    todos=todo_list,
    current_task="Working on feature X",
    context={"project": "AI Personas"},
    discoveries=["Found issue Y"],
    next_steps=["Implement Z"]
)
```

### Loading State
```python
loaded_state = manager.load_session_state()
if loaded_state:
    todos = loaded_state['todos']  # Complete todo items!
```

## Benefits

1. **No Lost Work**: Full todo descriptions are preserved
2. **Session Continuity**: Can resume exactly where you left off
3. **Statistics Tracking**: Know your progress at a glance
4. **Memory MCP Integration**: Persistent across Claude sessions
5. **Automatic Saving**: Todo hook ensures state is always current

## Migration

Old session states with just todo IDs will be detected and flagged as "old format". The system will continue to work but won't be able to restore the descriptions for those old todos.
