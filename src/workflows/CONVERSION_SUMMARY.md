## Key Improvements in YAML Format

1. **Structured Metadata** - Version, type, tags, duration, role
2. **Typed Inputs** - Proper validation with enums, patterns, defaults
3. **Prerequisites** - Clear requirements before execution
4. **Action Types** - Standardized actions (execute-workflow, shell-command, etc.)
5. **Error Handling** - Consistent strategy and notifications
6. **Outputs** - Defined outputs for workflow chaining
7. **Success Criteria** - Clear definition of success

## Next Steps

1. Update workflow references in the system to use new IDs (wf0-wf13)
2. Test workflow loading and validation with the new engine
3. Update UI to dynamically load workflows from YAML files
4. Migrate any remaining inline workflow logic to the new format
5. Create workflow documentation for persona developers
