MCP Integration for /remember Command
This file shows how the remember command integrates with actual MCP functions in Claude.

In the Claude environment, these functions are available directly:
- mcp__memory__read_graph()
- mcp__memory__search_nodes(query)
- mcp__memory__open_nodes(names)
- mcp__memory__delete_entities(names)
- mcp__serena__list_memories()
- mcp__serena__read_memory(filename)
- mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed()
- mcp__serena__onboarding()
